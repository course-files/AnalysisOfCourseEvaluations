### Interesting Correlations

Correlations worth noting include:

-   **0.78 correlation** between "lectures slides" and "lecture notes on some of the lecture slides": *Having lecture notes to accompany some lecture slides may improve the overall quality of the lecture slide*

-   **0.72 correlation** between "the quality of the lectures given (quality measured by the breadth (the full span of knowledge of a subject) and depth (the extent to which specific topics are focused upon, amplified, and explored) of learning - NOT quality measured by how fun, comical, or entertaining the lectures are)" and "the integration of practical labs in most classes even if it is not in a computer lab": *Mixing practicals with theory in the same class may improve the overall quality of the lecture.*

-   **0.72 correlation** between "Supplementary videos to watch as an additional explanation of a topic" and "Supplementary content to read": *Students who find the supplementary videos useful with regard to their learning are likely to also find the supplementary notes useful*

-   **0.7 correlation** between "understood Concept 2 (Conceptual Data Modelling)" and "understood Concept 3 (Database Constraints)": *Most students who do not understand Concept 2 also do not understand Concept 3. It may be necessary for students to understand Concept 2 before moving on to Concept 3.*

-   **-0.56 correlation** between "Absenteeism" and "Coursework Marks": *It is probable that the higher the absenteeism, the lower the student's coursework marks*

-   **-0.29 correlation** between "Absenteeism" and "Understood Concept 1": *It is probable that the more late students are to register for the course and begin the semester, the harder it is for them to understand concept 1*

The negative correlation between "absenteeism" and "coursework marks" is slightly stronger among the female students, i.e., the more classes a student misses, the worse their performance, especially for female students.

```{r DrillDownCorr1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(course_evaluation_dataset,
       aes(x = `Absenteeism`, y = `Coursework`, shape = Gender, color = Gender)) +

### Absenteeism Percentage

#### Absenteeism by Specific Class Group

Group C has the lowest absenteeism issues despite having a class on Friday afternoon.

```{r AbsenteeismBoxandWhiskerSpecificGroup, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=15, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
featurePlot(x = course_evaluation_dataset$Absenteeism, y = course_evaluation_dataset$`A - 2. Which group are you in?`, plot = "box")
```

\newpage

#### Absenteeism by Gender

Male students have more absenteeism challenges than female students.

```{r AbsenteeismBoxandWhiskerGender, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=15, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

### We can now perform lemmatization on the correctly spelt words ----

# This makes it easier to search for a word in the smaller lookup table
# instead of searching for a word in the entire lemma dictionary.

# Lemma lookup tables specific to a project can be made by referring to
# a pre-existing lemma dictionary. The code below shows how the "Hunspell"
# lemma dictionary is used to create  the lemma lookup table (subset of
# the dictionary).

# Lemma dictionaries include:
#   1. Hunspell: https://hunspell.github.io/ or
#                https://cran.r-project.org/package=hunspell
#   2. koRpus: https://reaktanz.de/?c=hacking&s=koRpus or
#              https://cran.r-project.org/package=koRpus
#   3. Michal Měchura (2016): https://www.lexiconista.com/
#   etc.

chordDiagram(nrc_likes_chord, transparency = .2)
title("Lexicon-Based Sentiment Analysis of Course Evaluation Likes per Class Group")

The sentiments expressed based on the choice of words are similar across all the 3 groups, i.e., positive sentiments.

### Chord Diagram of Sentiments for Likes per Class Gender

```{r ChordDiagramLikesPerGender, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

The results are similar for both genders but the male students are more positive and express the sentiment of trust more based on their choice of words for the "likes question".

chordDiagram(nrc_wishes_chord, transparency = .2)
title("Lexicon-Based Sentiment Analysis of Course Evaluation Wishes per Class Group")

```

Group A and C express more negative sentiments with Group C being the only group expressing fear based on their choice of words for the "wishes question". This may be attributed to the fact that Group C has missed a number of classes due to the events and holidays on Fridays. Group C is the only group with a class on Friday.

The reason for Group A's negative sentiments needs to be investigated further.

\newpage

### Chord Diagram of Sentiments for Wishes per Gender

```{r ChordDiagramPerGender_Wishes, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

                         rep(5, length(unique(nrc_wishes_chord[[2]])) - 1), 15))

chordDiagram(nrc_wishes_chord, transparency = .2)
title("Lexicon-Based Sentiment Analysis of Course Evaluation Wishes per Gender")
```

The sentiments for wishes are similar across both genders but female students express more fear than male students based on their choice of words.

## Topic Modelling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based)

The goal of topic modelling is to identify latent (hidden) terms (topics) in the students' course evaluation textual feedback. In this case, a topic is a mixture of words and a student's textual feedback is a combination of one or more topics (mixed-membership model).

```{r Create_a_DTM, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, include=FALSE}

# format. The conversion into a DTM is done below:

# inspect(evaluation_likes_filtered_dtm)

evaluation_wishes_filtered_dtm <-    evaluation_wishes_filtered %>%   count(`Class Group`, Wishes, sort = TRUE) %>%   ungroup() %>%   cast_dtm(`Class Group`, Wishes, n)
# inspect(evaluation_likes_filtered_dtm)

# evaluation_topics_filtered_dtm <-    evaluation_topics_filtered %>%   count(`Class Group`, Topics, sort = TRUE) %>%   ungroup() %>%   cast_dtm(`Class Group`, Topics, n)
# inspect(evaluation_topics_filtered_dtm)

The 3 topics for the "likes" (as guided by the LDA model) are:

1.  Topic 1: Well-Taught for Ease of Understanding

2.  Topic 2: Practical and the use of Slack for Technical Troubleshooting

3.  Topic 3: Organized

```{r visualizations_for_likes_topic_modelling, echo=FALSE}
likes_topics <- tidy(likes_topic_model, matrix = "beta")
likes_top_terms <-
  likes_topics %>%
  group_by (topic) %>%
  top_n(10, beta) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(topic, -beta)

likes_top_terms %>%
  mutate(term = reorder(term, beta)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(term, beta, fill = factor(topic))) +   geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +   facet_wrap(~topic, scales = "free") +   theme_minimal() +   theme(plot.title =            element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 18)) +   labs(     title = "Topic Model of Course Evaluation Likes",     caption = "Top Terms by Topic (betas)"     ) +   ylab("") +   xlab("") +   coord_flip()
```

The 4 topics for the "wishes" (as guided by the LDA model) are:

1.  Topic 1 and 4: Extend the deadlines

2.  Topic 2: Reduce the group work

3.  Topic 3: More breaks during lectures

```{r visualizations_for_wishes_topic_modelling, echo=FALSE}
wishes_topics <- tidy(wishes_topic_model, matrix = "beta")
wishes_top_terms <-
  wishes_topics %>%
  group_by (topic) %>%

`Lecture Notes on Slides` = `D - 10. Lecture notes on some of the lecture slides`,
`Actual Lectures` = `D - 11. The quality of the lectures given (quality measured by the breadth (the full span of knowledge of a subject) and depth (the extent to which specific topics are focused upon, amplified, and explored) of learning - NOT quality measured by how fun, comical, or entertaining the lectures are)`,
`Lab and Theory Integration` = `D - 12. The integration of practical labs in most classes even if it is not in a computer lab`,

`Coursework Marks` = `Coursework`
