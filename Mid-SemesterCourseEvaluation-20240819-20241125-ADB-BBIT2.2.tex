\subsection{Correlations}\label{correlations}

Please refer to \hyperref[appendix-a-full-name-of-variables]{Appendix A:
Full Name of Variables} for the full name of the variables listed in the
correlation plot below.

\includegraphics{Mid-SemesterCourseEvaluation-20240819-20241125-ADB-BBIT2.2_files/figure-latex/CorrelationMatrixWithFigures-1.pdf}

\subsubsection{Interesting Correlations}\label{interesting-correlations}

Correlations worth noting include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{0.78 correlation} between ``lectures slides'' and ``lecture
  notes on some of the lecture slides'': \emph{Having lecture notes to
  accompany some lecture slides may improve the overall quality of the
  lecture slide}
\item
  \textbf{0.72 correlation} between ``the quality of the lectures given
  (quality measured by the breadth (the full span of knowledge of a
  subject) and depth (the extent to which specific topics are focused
  upon, amplified, and explored) of learning - NOT quality measured by
  how fun, comical, or entertaining the lectures are)'' and ``the
  integration of practical labs in most classes even if it is not in a
  computer lab'': \emph{Mixing practicals with theory in the same class
  may improve the overall quality of the lecture.}
\item
  \textbf{0.72 correlation} between ``Supplementary videos to watch as
  an additional explanation of a topic'' and ``Supplementary content to
  read'': \emph{Students who find the supplementary videos useful with
  regard to their learning are likely to also find the supplementary
  notes useful}
\item
  \textbf{0.7 correlation} between ``understood Concept 2 (Conceptual
  Data Modelling)'' and ``understood Concept 3 (Database Constraints)'':
  \emph{Most students who do not understand Concept 2 also do not
  understand Concept 3. It may be necessary for students to understand
  Concept 2 before moving on to Concept 3.}
\item
  \textbf{-0.56 correlation} between ``Absenteeism'' and ``Coursework
  Marks'': \emph{It is probable that the higher the absenteeism, the
  lower the student's coursework marks}
\item
  \textbf{-0.29 correlation} between ``Absenteeism'' and ``Understood
  Concept 1'': \emph{It is probable that the more late students are to
  register for the course and begin the semester, the harder it is for
  them to understand concept 1}
\end{itemize}

\newpage

The negative correlation between ``absenteeism'' and ``coursework
marks'' is slightly stronger among the female students, i.e., the more
classes a student misses, the worse their performance, especially for
female students.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Absenteeism Percentage}\label{absenteeism-percentage}

\paragraph{Absenteeism by Specific Class
Group}\label{absenteeism-by-specific-class-group}

Group C has the lowest absenteeism issues despite having a class on
Friday afternoon.

\includegraphics{Mid-SemesterCourseEvaluation-20240819-20241125-ADB-BBIT2.2_files/figure-latex/AbsenteeismBoxandWhiskerSpecificGroup-1.pdf}

\newpage

\paragraph{Absenteeism by Gender}\label{absenteeism-by-gender}

Male students have more absenteeism challenges than female students.

\includegraphics{Mid-SemesterCourseEvaluation-20240819-20241125-ADB-BBIT2.2_files/figure-latex/AbsenteeismBoxandWhiskerGender-1.pdf}

\newpage

\section{Qualitative Data Analysis}\label{qualitative-data-analysis}

\subsection{Sentiment Analysis
(Lexicon-Based)}\label{sentiment-analysis-lexicon-based}

\subsubsection{Chord Diagram of Sentiments for Likes per Class
Group}\label{chord-diagram-of-sentiments-for-likes-per-class-group}

\includegraphics{Mid-SemesterCourseEvaluation-20240819-20241125-ADB-BBIT2.2_files/figure-latex/ChordDiagramLikesPerGroup-1.pdf}

The sentiments expressed based on the choice of words are similar across
all the 3 groups, i.e., positive sentiments.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Chord Diagram of Sentiments for Likes per Class
Gender}\label{chord-diagram-of-sentiments-for-likes-per-class-gender}

\includegraphics{Mid-SemesterCourseEvaluation-20240819-20241125-ADB-BBIT2.2_files/figure-latex/ChordDiagramLikesPerGender-1.pdf}

The results are similar for both genders but the male students are more
positive and express the sentiment of trust more based on their choice
of words for the ``likes question''.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Chord Diagram of Sentiments for Wishes per Class
Group}\label{chord-diagram-of-sentiments-for-wishes-per-class-group}

\includegraphics{Mid-SemesterCourseEvaluation-20240819-20241125-ADB-BBIT2.2_files/figure-latex/ChordDiagramPerGroup_Wishes-1.pdf}

Group A and C express more negative sentiments with Group C being the
only group expressing fear based on their choice of words for the
``wishes question''. This may be attributed to the fact that Group C has
missed a number of classes due to the events and holidays on Fridays.
Group C is the only group with a class on Friday.

The reason for Group A's negative sentiments needs to be investigated
further.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Chord Diagram of Sentiments for Wishes per
Gender}\label{chord-diagram-of-sentiments-for-wishes-per-gender}

\includegraphics{Mid-SemesterCourseEvaluation-20240819-20241125-ADB-BBIT2.2_files/figure-latex/ChordDiagramPerGender_Wishes-1.pdf}

The sentiments for wishes are similar across both genders but female
students express more fear than male students based on their choice of
words.

\newpage

\subsection{Topic Modelling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
based)}\label{topic-modelling-latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda-based}

The goal of topic modelling is to identify latent (hidden) terms
(topics) in the students' course evaluation textual feedback. In this
case, a topic is a mixture of words and a student's textual feedback is
a combination of one or more topics (mixed-membership model).

The 3 topics for the ``likes'' (as guided by the LDA model) are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Topic 1: Well-Taught for Ease of Understanding
\item
  Topic 2: Practical and the use of Slack for Technical Troubleshooting
\item
  Topic 3: Organized
\end{enumerate}

\includegraphics{Mid-SemesterCourseEvaluation-20240819-20241125-ADB-BBIT2.2_files/figure-latex/visualizations_for_likes_topic_modelling-1.pdf}

\newpage

The 4 topics for the ``wishes'' (as guided by the LDA model) are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Topic 1 and 4: Extend the deadlines
\item
  Topic 2: Reduce the group work
\item
  Topic 3: More breaks during lectures
\end{enumerate}
