### Interesting Correlations

The following are hypothetical statements given that "correlation does not imply causation".

-   **.81 correlation** between "Acquired Skill 6 (ClickHouse)" and "Acquired Skill 5 (ksqlDB)": *The two technologies are related and taught in the same lab (Data Engineering).*

-   **.82 correlation** between "Acquired Skill 4 (Kafka)" and "Acquired Skill 5 (ksqlDB)": *The two technologies are related and taught in the same lab and concept (Data Engineering).*

-   **.78 correlation** between "Acquired Skill 6 (ClickHouse)" and "Acquired Skill 4 (Kafka)": *The two technologies are related and taught in the same lab (Data Engineering).*

-   **.75 correlation** between "Lab Manuals (Lab manuals that outline the steps to follow during the labs)" and "Lab Submissions (Required lab work submissions at the end of each lab manual that outline the activity to be done on your own)": *The more the effort to clearly outline the steps to be done in a lab manual, the more impact it has on the students' learning.*

-   **.76 correlation** between "The quality of lecture slides" and "the quality of lecture notes on some of the slides: *The higher the quality of the slides, the higher the quality of the notes on some of the slides.*

(1) A **.76 correlation** between "The quality of lecture slides" and "the quality of lecture notes on some of the slides.

(2) A **.75 correlation** between "Lab Manuals (Lab manuals that outline the steps to follow during the labs)" and "Lab Submissions (Required lab work submissions at the end of each lab manual that outline the activity to be done on your own)".

### Absenteeism Percentage

The lower the absenteeism, the more a student makes use of the lab manuals for practical classes. And the more a student makes use of the lab manuals, the more the lab submissions have an impact on their overall acquisition of skills.

With this in mind, a further investigation of the **absenteeism percentage** is presented below.

### We can now perform lemmatization on the correctly spelt words ----
# We need to first create a lemma lookup table. The lemmatize_strings()
# function will then use this lookup table to replace the words.

# Think of the lemma lookup table as a subset of an entire lemma dictionary.
# This makes it easier to search for a word in the smaller lookup table
# instead of searching for a word in the entire lemma dictionary.

# Lemma lookup tables specific to a project can be made by referring to
# a pre-existing lemma dictionary. The code below shows how the "Hunspell"
# lemma dictionary is used to create  the lemma lookup table (subset of
# the dictionary).

# Lemma dictionaries include:
#   1. Hunspell: https://hunspell.github.io/ or
#                https://cran.r-project.org/package=hunspell
#   2. koRpus: https://reaktanz.de/?c=hacking&s=koRpus or
#              https://cran.r-project.org/package=koRpus
#   3. Michal Měchura (2016): https://www.lexiconista.com/
#   etc.

lemma_dictionary_for_likes <-
  make_lemma_dictionary(evaluation_likes_filtered$`Likes`,
                        engine = "hunspell")

evaluation_likes_filtered$`Likes` <-

```

The "likes" refer to the answer to the question, "Write two things you liked about the teaching and learning in this course." The sentiments expressed through the "likes" are:

```

The "wishes" refer to the answer to the question, "Write at least one recommendation to improve the teaching and learning in this course (for future classes)". The sentiments expressed through the "wishes" are:

```{r OverallSentimentForWishes, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=15, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## Topic Modelling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based)

The goal of topic modelling is to identify latent (hidden) terms (topics) in the students' course evaluation textual feedback. In this case, a topic is a mixture of words and a student's textual feedback is a combination of one or more topics (mixed-membership model).

```{r Create_a_DTM, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, include=FALSE}
# LDA requires the data to be presented in a Document-Term Matrix (DTM)
# format. The conversion into a DTM is done below: 
evaluation_likes_filtered_dtm <-    evaluation_likes_filtered %>%   count(`Class Group`, Likes, sort = TRUE) %>%   ungroup() %>%   cast_dtm(`Class Group`, Likes, n)
# inspect(evaluation_likes_filtered_dtm)

evaluation_wishes_filtered_dtm <-    evaluation_wishes_filtered %>%   count(`Class Group`, Wishes, sort = TRUE) %>%   ungroup() %>%   cast_dtm(`Class Group`, Wishes, n)
# inspect(evaluation_likes_filtered_dtm)

evaluation_topics_filtered_dtm <-    evaluation_topics_filtered %>%   count(`Class Group`, Topics, sort = TRUE) %>%   ungroup() %>%   cast_dtm(`Class Group`, Topics, n)
# inspect(evaluation_topics_filtered_dtm)

# Check for rows with at least one non-zero entry
rows_with_nonzero <- apply(evaluation_topics_filtered_dtm, 1, function(row) any(row != 0))

# Select rows with at least one non-zero entry
evaluation_topics_filtered_dtm_non_zero <- evaluation_topics_filtered_dtm[rows_with_nonzero, , drop = FALSE]
```

```{r train_LDA_model_for_topic_modelling, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, include=FALSE}
likes_topic_model <- LDA(evaluation_likes_filtered_dtm,
                         k = 3,
                         control = list(seed = 7))

wishes_topic_model <- LDA(evaluation_wishes_filtered_dtm,
                          k = 4,
                          control = list(seed = 7))

topics_topic_model <- LDA(evaluation_topics_filtered_dtm_non_zero,

                          control = list(seed = 7))
```

The 2 topics for the "likes" (as guided by the LDA model) are:

1.  Topic 1: Well-Explained Lectures

2.  Topic 2: Collaborative Environment

3.  Topic 3: Well-Taught for Ease of Understanding

```{r visualizations_for_likes_topic_modelling, echo=FALSE}

likes_top_terms <-
  likes_topics %>%
  group_by (topic) %>%
  top_n(10, beta) %>%

  arrange(topic, -beta)

likes_top_terms %>%
  mutate(term = reorder(term, beta)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(term, beta, fill = factor(topic))) +   geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +   facet_wrap(~topic, scales = "free") +   theme_minimal() +   theme(plot.title =            element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 18)) +   labs(     title = "Topic Model of Course Evaluation Likes",     caption = "Top Terms by Topic (betas)"     ) +   ylab("") +   xlab("") +   coord_flip()
```

\newpage

The 5 topics for the "wishes" (as guided by the LDA model) are:

1.  Topic 1: Reduce the Workload

2.  Topic 2: Reduce the Complexity of the Labs

3.  Topic 3: Application of Data Engineering

4.  Topic 4: Application of Python

```{r visualizations_for_wishes_topic_modelling, echo=FALSE}

```

\newpage

The 3 topics for the recommended BI content (as guided by the LDA model) are:

1.  Topic 1: Python

2.  Topic 2: Tableau

3.  Topic 3: PowerBI

```{r visualizations_for_recommended_topics_topic_modelling, echo=FALSE}
